    <ul>
        <li>HP - Health Points, how much health you have left</li>
        <li>AD - Attack Damage, how much physical damage you do, it is affected by enemy armour, your pen and cleave
        </li>
        <li>AP - Ability Power, how much magic damage you do, is not affected by anything (true damage - for now)</li>
        <li>Armour - Percentage of enemy damage reduced (if you have 50 armour you will reduce the damage by 50%)</li>
        <li>Pen - Armour penetration, how much enemy armour you will ignore</li>
        <li>Cleave - Armour reduction, reduces the enemy armour by percentage (if you have 50 cleave, you will reduce
            enemy armour by 50%)</li>
        <li>Crit% - Percent chance to get a critical attack (the damage critical attacks do ignores enemy armour - in
            other words, crit is true damage)</li>
        <li>CritDMG% - A percentage of your AD gets converted to the damage done (if you have 50 CritDMG% and 50 AD, you
            will do 25 true damage)</li>
        <li>Level - The level of your character (you can check enemy level by opening the web browser console - F12 for
            google chrome)</li>
        <li>EXP - The experience ammount of your character</li>
        <li>Required EXP - How much EXP you need for the next level, it rises by 40% + 10 XP each level up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Difficulty options</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Easy - Gives 0.8 times ammount of score, the enemy attack is instantaneous and always gives its 100%</li>
        <li>Normal - Damage scales based on how accurately the player hit the middle of the attack bar, the damage scales like a concave function so it is very forgiving</li>
        <li>Hard - Damage scales from 50% to 100% based exactly on how accurately the player hit the  middle of the  bar</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Damage calculation formula if you want to see it</h2>
    <p>REGULAR DAMAGE: player.AD*(1-(((enemy.Armour*(1-player.Cleave/100))-player.Pen)/100)) + player.AP</p>
    <p>CRITICAL DAMAGE: player.AD * (player.CritDamage/100)</p>
    <h2>EXP calculations</h2>

        <figcaption>Enemy level scaling</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>player.EXP += enemy.MAXHP + enemy.AD*3 + enemy.AP*4 + enemy.Armour*2 + enemy.Cleave*2 + enemy.Pen*3</p>
    <p>enemyExp += Math.log(1.4 * enemyExp + 1.1) / Math.log(50)</p>
    <p>In short, the enemy gets their EXP incresed logarithmically whilst the player gets more EXP from tougher enemies
    </p>
    <p>The enemy stats are determined by their level and their other stats<br>
        For example, enemy HP is random but based on their level<br>
        If the enemy randomly gets the most HP it can get it's AD will be reduced and so will be the other stats</p>

    <h2>Specialties (Mechaincs)</h2>
    <p><b>Precision bar</b> - The bar at the bottom of the screen, it represents a skill based mechanic. First you must initiate an attack by clicking attack 
        or by pressing the (A) button. A blue bar will start filling the bar, your objective is to press attack again as close to the 50% mark as possible.
        The more precise you are the more damage you will do. This mechanic affects your damage drastically. If you completely miss you will do 50% damage 
        whereas if you're perfectly percise you will achieve 100% of your deserved damage. The damage modifier follows different functions based on the difficulty you pick. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Overkill</b> - Caused when the enemy ends up with negative health bigger than it's original max hp (if the
        MAXHP was 10 and it's current health is -11), 
        gives an exponentially increasing ammount of EXP (1.9 to the power of the enemy level) because the bigger the
        enemy level the harder it is to overkill, 
        making one shot builds survive for longer</p>
    <p><b>Magic scaling</b> - The more AP you get the more AP you get. For each time you upgrade your AP the next
        upgrade will increase the AP offer by a small ammount, starting with an increase of 1 and then less with each upgrade. It follows this mathematic formula: (1/1.3)^playerAPUpgrade</p>
    <p><b>Chain attack</b> - The longer you fight your opponent the more damage you will do. The damage increases by 10% with each attack.</p>  
    <p><b>Critical experience</b> - If you score a critical hit you are rewarded with the damage dealt as bonus experience. This mechanic was necessary to make crit builds viable.</p> 

    <h2>Recommended builds</h2>
    <p><b>Tank mage</b> - Put your points into AP, health and armour. If you manage to survive for long enough the AP
        scaling follows the enemy scaling. It utilises the chain attack mechanic and the magic scaling mechanic.</p>
    <p><b>Assassin</b> - Spam AD and penetration, you will overkill enemies for a while (getting an EXP bonus) before
        getting outscaled and instakilled. Provides quickest playtroughs.</p>
    <p><b>Bruiser</b> - Keep a balance between HP and AD upgrades, proves to be the most solid method that can bring you
        far but gets weaker over time. It utilises the chain attack mechanic.</p>
    <p><b>Crits For Days?</b> - In theory having critical strike stats developed would make AD increasingly useful, it
        is however reliant on luck. Utilises the critical experience mechanic.</p>

    <p>Ever been bored of having to move your mouse in order to attack? ♪Move it move it♫ no longer.<br>

    <h2>Patch notes</h2>
    <p><b>Patch 0.2</b> - Character select remade, color pallete changed, added 4 new characters (sacred blade, holy moly, boxer, thorned), added intro</p>
